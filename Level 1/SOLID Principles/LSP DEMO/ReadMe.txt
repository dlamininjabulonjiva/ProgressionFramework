Liskov Substitution Principle
	- LSP states that the objects of a superclass must be replaceable or interchangeable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the code..

I have created two projects which do the following:
	1. They calculate the calories for a dessert
	2. Then the get the room melting temperature for each dessert
	
LSPBefore project breacks the LSP cos of some code break in the Pie dessert class. And LSPAfter project complies with the LSP.

I have created a program that extracts the date of birth from an ID number. I also added some few tests.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of interfaces. 
So I have created an interface with a GetDateOfBirth method that returns a nullable datetime.

I also added a test builder to demonstrate the use of NSubstitute.

# OPENID AND OAUTH
OpenID and OAuth are both authentication and authorization protocols that enable users to grant access to their personal information to third-party applications or services. However, they differ in their objectives, use cases, and implementation.

# OpenID
OpenID is an authentication protocol that allows users to authenticate themselves to various online services using a single set of login credentials. 
With OpenID, users can create an account with an OpenID provider (such as Google, Yahoo, or Facebook) and use their credentials to log in to other sites that support OpenID authentication. 
The process involves the following steps:
	 The user requests access to a service that supports OpenID authentication.
	 The service provider sends the user to the OpenID provider to authenticate.
	 The OpenID provider verifies the user's identity and sends a response back to the service provider, which allows the user to access the service.
	
For example, let's say you want to log in to StackOverflow using your Google account. StackOverflow supports OpenID authentication, so you can click on the "Sign in with Google" button, which will redirect you to the Google login page. After you log in with your Google credentials, Google will send a response back to StackOverflow, which will allow you to access your StackOverflow account.

# OAuth
OAuth is an authorization protocol that enables users to grant access to their data to third-party applications or services without giving them their login credentials. With OAuth, users can control what information they share and with whom. 
The process involves the following steps:
	 The user grants permission to a third-party application or service to access their data.
	 The third-party application or service obtains an access token from the authorization server.
	 The access token allows the third-party application or service to access the user's data on the resource server.
	
For example, let's say you want to use a fitness tracking app that connects to your Fitbit account. The fitness tracking app uses OAuth to request permission to access your Fitbit data, and if you grant permission, it will obtain an access token from Fitbit.
The access token will allow the fitness tracking app to retrieve your Fitbit data (such as your heart rate and steps) from the Fitbit API.

So, OpenID and OAuth are both important protocols for online authentication and authorization. OpenID is used to authenticate users across multiple sites, while OAuth is

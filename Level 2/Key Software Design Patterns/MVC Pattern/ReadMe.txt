MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern used in software engineering that separates an application's logic into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.
This pattern is used to create maintainable and modular code, making it easier to update, test, and modify.

In this example, the User class is the model, which represents the data and business logic of a user.
The UserView class is the view, which is responsible for rendering the user data to the user interface.
The UserController class is the controller, which acts as an intermediary between the model and view.

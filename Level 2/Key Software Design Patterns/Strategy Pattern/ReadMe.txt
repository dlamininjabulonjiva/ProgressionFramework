The strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an object to dynamically change its behavior at runtime by encapsulating different algorithms or strategies and making them interchangeable.
The pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
The strategy pattern allows the algorithms to vary independently of the clients that use them.

I have created a financial application that calculates the price of a financial instrument based on various pricing models.
This application uses the strategy pattern.

# This Keyword
- In JavaScript, "this" is a keyword that refers to the current execution context, specifically the value of the "this" keyword is determined by how a function is called.
- The value of "this" can change depending on the context in which the function is called.

# Purpose of this project
I have created this project to demonstrate the usage of the 'this' keyword in different contexts.
